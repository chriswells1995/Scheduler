# Scheduler

The calander code now has comments for almost every line of code, explaining what the lines of code do.
In short, most of the CSS helps to create an aesthetically pleasing page.
The javascript allows the user to type in whatever they want to the large middle row accompanying each hour-block,
and they may save their input to the local storage, The js also gets the current date and time, displaying the date, 
and highlighting the rows based on weather they are past, present, or future. 

Also, I added a feature. A "clear all" button that removes everything from the local storage and re-loads the page so that rows appear blank.
Useful if all of your plans are canceled (maybe because of a spreading virus) and you need to cancel all of your plans at once.
